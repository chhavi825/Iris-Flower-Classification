ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
This project classifies iris flowers into one of three species â€” *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* â€” based on flower features like petal and sepal length and width.

ðŸ“Š Objective
- Classify iris species using machine learning models:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Tree
  - Logistic Regression

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: Built-in `iris` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target:
  - Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Pair plots color-coded by species
  - Histograms and scatter plots for feature distribution

- Decision Boundaries:
  - Plotted for each classifier using two selected features for visual clarity.

ðŸ§ª Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Each model is trained and evaluated on the dataset to compare performance.


ðŸ§® How It Works
1. Load and explore the Iris dataset
2. Visualize features and relationships
3. Train the model(s)
4. Evaluate accuracy
5. Visualize decision boundaries
